#This library is dedicated to handle the Tree of Nodes in the gameplay. The Kernel
#and Nodes (structures) will form a Tree to know what Node is connected to the Kernel
#and what is not. What is connected to the Kernel emits a radius in which the player
#can construct structures and units into it. Units or structures not "connected"
#to the Kernel via Nodes will act normal.
